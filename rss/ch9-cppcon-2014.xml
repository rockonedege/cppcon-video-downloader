He is currently the Parallel Programming Languages Architect at Intel Corp., where he coordinates the efforts of teams working on Cilk Plus, TBB, OpenMP, and other parallelism languages, frameworks, and tools targeted to C&#43;&#43;, C, and Fortran users. Pablo came to Intel from Cilk Arts, Inc., which was acquired by Intel in 2009. During his time at Cilk Arts, he co-authored the paper &quot;Reducers and other Cilk&#43;&#43; Hyperobjects&quot;, which won best paper at the SPAA 2009 conference. His current work is focused on creating simpler and more powerful parallel programming languages and tools for Intel's customers and promoting adoption of parallel constructs into the C&#43;&#43; and C standards. He lives with his family in southern New Hampshire, USA. When not working on parallel programming, he enjoys studying the viola, skiing, snowboarding, and watching opera.

His interests include concurrency, programming language and library design, and modern C&#43;&#43;. Artur is one of the co-authors of the Parallel STL proposal; his team is now working on the prototype implementation of the proposal.<br>ADE MILLER - Ade Miller writes C&#43;&#43; for fun. He wrote his first N-body model in BASIC on an 8-bit microcomputer 30 years ago and never really looked back. He started using C&#43;&#43; in the early 90s. Recently, he's written two books on parallel programming with C&#43;&#43;; &quot;C&#43;&#43; AMP: Accelerated Massive Parallelism with Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43;&quot; and &quot;Parallel Programming with Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43;&quot;. Ade spends the long winters in Washington contributing to the open source C&#43;&#43; AMP Algorithms Library and well as a few other projects. His summers are mostly spent crashing expensive bicycles into trees.

He works on the 'await' feature. Prior to joining C&#43;&#43; team, Gor was working on distributed systems in Windows Clustering team.<br>MICHAEL WONG - You can talk to me about anything including C&#43;&#43; (even C and that language that shall remain nameless but starts with F), Transactional Memory, Parallel Programming, OpenMP, astrophysics (where my degree came from), tennis (still trying to see if I can play for a living), travel, and the best food (which I am on a permanent quest to eat). Michael Wong is the CEO of OpenMP. He is the IBM and Canadian representative to the C&#43;&#43; Standard and OpenMP Committee. And did I forget to say he is a Director of ISOCPP.org and a VP, Vice-Chair of Programming Languages for Canada's Standard Council. He has so many titles, its a wonder he can get anything done. Oh, and he chairs the WG21 SG5 Transactional Memory, and is the co-author of a number C&#43;&#43;11/OpenMP/TM features including generalized attributes, user-defined literals, inheriting constructors, weakly ordered memory models, and explicit conversion operators. Having been the past C&#43;&#43; team lead to IBM´s XL C&#43;&#43; compiler means he has been messing around with designing C&#43;&#43; compilers for twenty years. His current research interest, i.e. what he would like to do if he had time is in the area of parallel programming, transactional memory, C&#43;&#43; benchmark performance, object model, generic programming and template metaprogramming. He holds a B.Sc from University of Toronto, and a Masters in Mathematics from University of Waterloo. He has been asked to speak at ACCU, C&#43;&#43;Now, Meeting C&#43;&#43;, CASCON, and many Universities, research centers and companies, except his own, where he has to listen. Now he and his wife loves to teach their two children to be curious about everything.<br>--<br>Videos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a class="yt-uix-redirect-link" dir="ltr" title="http://www.BashFilms.com" href="http://www.bashfilms.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.BashFilms.com</a></p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Events/CPP/C-PP-Con-2014/RSS/mp4high&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:f7412adf819448029611a3e300143c6f">]]></description>

Embarcadero has successfully delivered the first commercial compiler for Windows based on CLANG/LLVM. This session describes the benefits of CLANG/LLVM as well as the challenges in bringing it to the Windows operating system.

In this talk, I will present Boost.Hana[1], an experimental C&#43;&#43;14 library for heterogeneous computation. The library takes metaprogramming to a whole new level of expressiveness by unifying the well-known Boost.MPL and Boost.Fusion libraries under a single generic, purely functional interface. The library incorporates some of the most recent advances in C&#43;&#43; metaprogramming; I will give an overview of the most interesting implementation techniques used internally.

    <title>C++ On Mars: Incorporating C++ Into Mars Rover Flight Software</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><a class="yt-uix-redirect-link" dir="ltr" title="http://www.cppcon.org" href="http://www.cppcon.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cppcon.org</a><br>--<br>Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: <a class="yt-uix-redirect-link" dir="ltr" title="https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014" href="https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014</a><br>--<br>One of the more challenging aspects of developing flight software (FSW) for NASA's Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover was how to enable them to drive themselves safely through unknown Martian terrain. When the MER mission was approved in the year 2000, JPL researchers had already demonstrated that capability on prototype rovers [1] using software written primarily in C&#43;&#43; on a VxWorks realtime O/S platform with shared memory. So when asked to incorporate that capability into the MER vehicles which also relied on a similar VxWorks realtime O/S, the team concluded it would be safest and most expedient to incorporate the already field-tested C&#43;&#43; software. But that presented a challenge, since at that point all rover FSW development was mandated to be done mainly in the C programming language.<br><br>In this talk we present some of the challenges we faced and solutions we found in deploying C&#43;&#43; onto the Mars Rovers.

    <itunes:summary>http://www.cppcon.org--Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014--One of the more challenging aspects of developing flight software (FSW) for NASA&#39;s Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover was how to enable them to drive themselves safely through unknown Martian terrain. When the MER mission was approved in the year 2000, JPL researchers had already demonstrated that capability on prototype rovers [1] using software written primarily in C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; on a VxWorks realtime O/S platform with shared memory. So when asked to incorporate that capability into the MER vehicles which also relied on a similar VxWorks realtime O/S, the team concluded it would be safest and most expedient to incorporate the already field-tested C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; software. But that presented a challenge, since at that point all rover FSW development was mandated to be done mainly in the C programming language.In this talk we present some of the challenges we faced and solutions we found in deploying C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; onto the Mars Rovers. For example, dynamic allocation was initially precluded, but development of a specialized memory allocator (using the C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; &amp;quot;placement new&amp;quot; operator) enabled us to incorporate it safely into the flight system. We will discuss what aspects of C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; were incorporated, what simulation environments aided development, describe some of the tools used to validate system behavior, and explain how our success using C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; for the implementation of autonomous navigation on MER has influenced future FSW efforts.[1] Jeffrey Biesiadecki, Mark W.

He is the owner of Ciere Consulting which provides software consulting and contracting services, C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; training, and Project Recovery for failing multidisciplinary engineering projects.--Videos Filmed &amp;amp; Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com </itunes:summary>

This talk demonstrates architectures, techniques, and lessons learned rooted in actual experience with using C&#43;&#43; to deliver several major cross-platform projects across iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote) and the SQL Server PowerBI. Each presents a different case study: For example, Office already used C&#43;&#43;, whereas PowerBI was originally written in Silverlight and then rewritten in C&#43;&#43;; Office is a set of user-facing apps, whereas PowerBI is a system component. Although some of these are demanding first-tier &quot;Cadillac&quot; applications, we expect this experience to be a model for the future as more and more apps fall into this category and use C&#43;&#43; to target many popular platforms from (mostly) a single source base. This talk will cover the following key topics and tradeoffs: Rich vs. reach, including access to latest OS features (e.g., iOS 8 additions) and hardware features (e.g., vector units, GPUs). Consistency of functionality. Client code vs. server/service web code. Sharing vs. quality, including dialing appropriately between more shared code and high quality code.

How C&#43;&#43; enables things not feasible using other technologies. Velocity and enabling faster cross-platform development and deployment. Cost of maintenance, including time, size, and complexity (both breadth and depth). And, last but not least, developing in a single modern C&#43;&#43; source base built with different evolving C&#43;&#43; compilers, including VC&#43;&#43; and Clang/LLVM.<br>--<br>Tony Antoun is Director of Development for APEX, focusing on delivering Office on all Apple platforms and form factors (iPhone, iPad, Mac), as well as aligning the Office experience on other major platforms (Win32, WinRT, Android). Before that, Dev Manager for SQL PowerBI – a cross-platform interactive client data visualization solution (iOS, WinRT, Web) connected to the SQL Reporting cloud service. Before that, Dev Manager for HD-DVD, cross-plat client solution for High Definition interactivity of media experiences (Win32, WinCE, Linux, Xbox).<br>--<br>Igor Zaika is the Development Manager for the Office Core Experience team at Microsoft, responsible for shared UX components and application framework used by Office applications. Before that, Igor worked in various areas related to Office client applications, ranging from building Word Object Model and integrating VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) with Office, to shipping first version of OneNote for the WinRT platform.

This talk demonstrates architectures, techniques, and lessons learned rooted in actual experience with using C&#43;&#43; to deliver several major cross-platform projects across iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote) and the SQL Server PowerBI. Each presents a different case study: For example, Office already used C&#43;&#43;, whereas PowerBI was originally written in Silverlight and then rewritten in C&#43;&#43;; Office is a set of user-facing apps, whereas PowerBI is a system component. Although some of these are demanding first-tier &quot;Cadillac&quot; applications, we expect this experience to be a model for the future as more and more apps fall into this category and use C&#43;&#43; to target many popular platforms from (mostly) a single source base. This talk will cover the following key topics and tradeoffs: Rich vs. reach, including access to latest OS features (e.g., iOS 8 additions) and hardware features (e.g., vector units, GPUs). Consistency of functionality. Client code vs. server/service web code. Sharing vs. quality, including dialing appropriately between more shared code and high quality code. Drawing the line between the bulk of C&#43;&#43; code and interfacing with non-C&#43;&#43; for UX and PALs (platform adaptation/abstraction layers) for target-specific user interface and system services.

How C&#43;&#43; enables things not feasible using other technologies. Velocity and enabling faster cross-platform development and deployment. Cost of maintenance, including time, size, and complexity (both breadth and depth).

This talk is an introduction to the new features proposed for C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;17 in N3851 [TBD: update after Rapperswil] bringing all contiguous data into harmony and lifting it to higher dimensions: index, bounds, array_view and more. Attendees will also learn how indexable algorithms differ from the traditional elemental ones, and what does it mean for parallelism.--Łukasz Mendakiewicz is a software engineer at Microsoft, where he focuses on the customer experience with parallel programming models for C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;. He is especially interested in GPGPU acceleration, and puts this passion to work on C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; AMP. He holds an M.S. in Computer Science from AGH UST in Krakow, Poland.--Videos Filmed &amp;amp; Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com </itunes:summary>

One common form of misuse is to invoke a library function or method under circumstances where not all of its preconditions are satisfied, leading to undefined behavior. Contracts having undefined behavior are not necessarily undesirable, and (for many engineering reasons) are often optimal. Most would agree that a well-implemented library should do something other than silently continue when a pre-condition violation is detected, although these same folks might not agree on what specific action should be taken. Unfortunately, validating preconditions implies writing additional code that will execute at runtime. More code runs slower, and some would fairly argue that they should not be forced to pay for redundant runtime checks in the library software they use. Whether and to what extent library functions should validate their preconditions, and what should happen if a precondition violation is detected are questions that are best answered on an application by application basis - i.e., by the owner of main. &quot;Defensive Programming Done Right&quot; makes it all possible.</span><br><br><span>In this talk, we begin by reviewing the basic concepts of Design-By-Contract (DbC), and what we mean by the term &quot;Defensive Programming&quot; (DP). We then explore our overall approach to institutionalizing defensive programming in robust reusable library software such that each application can conveniently specify both the runtime budget (e.g., none, some, lots) for defensive checking, and also the specific action to be taken (e.g., abort, throw, spin) should a precondition violation occur. Along the way, we touch on how modern compilers and linkers work, binary compatibility, and the consequences of possibly violating the one-definition rule in mixed-mode builds. We conclude the talk by describing and then demonstrating our &quot;negative testing&quot; strategy (and supporting test apparatus) for readily verifying, in our component-level test drivers, that our defensive checks detect and report out-of-contract client use as intended. Actual source for the supporting utility components will be presented throughout the talk and made available afterwards.</span><br><span>--</span><br><span>John Lakos, author of &quot;Large Scale C&#43;&#43; Software Design.&quot;, serves at Bloomberg LP in New York City as a senior architect and mentor for C&#43;&#43; Software Development world-wide.

Previously, Dr. Lakos directed the design and development of infrastructure libraries for proprietary analytic financial applications at Bear Stearns. For 12 years prior, Dr. Lakos developed large frameworks and advanced ICCAD applications at Mentor Graphics, for which he holds multiple software patents. His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Computer Science ('97) and an Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering ('89) from Columbia University. Dr. Lakos received his undergraduate degrees from MIT in Mathematics ('82) and Computer Science ('81).

Among other things, Drew is the primary designer and implementor of HHVM's virtual instruction set architecture and Hack's Collections framework, and he was a core contributor to HHVM's JIT compiler in the early days of the project. Before Facebook, Drew was at Microsoft where he worked on improving the performance of Microsoft's runtime and JIT compiler for .NET languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, and more) known as the Common Language Runtime.

    <itunes:summary>http://www.cppcon.org--Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at:https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014--HHVM is a just-in-time compiler for PHP used by Facebook to serve billions of requests each day. This talk will give a quick overview of HHVM&#39;s history and architecture, followed by a deep dive into what made C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; the language of choice for writing HHVM.C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; hits a sweet spot between performance and control on one end, and safety, maintainability, and convenience on the other.The topics we&#39;ll cover will include:how to call into generated machine code from C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;;taking advantage of C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&#39;s power to control &amp;quot;unsafe&amp;quot; details with memory including how memory is allocated, field size and layout, unions, reinterpret_casts, bit-stealing;integrating generated machine code with C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; exception handling and C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; profiling tools;leveraging templates and using the X Macro technique to improve performance and maintainability;and taking advantage of new C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;11 features like unrestricted unions and move constructors.Finally, we&#39;ll go over some obstacles we encountered such as generating machine code that calls C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; virtual methods, and how C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&#39;s superb flexibility allowed us to work around these obstacles.--Drew Paroski is a Software Engineer at Facebook and a co-creator of the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) and the Hack programming language. Among other things, Drew is the primary designer and implementor of HHVM&#39;s virtual instruction set architecture and Hack&#39;s Collections framework, and he was a core contributor to HHVM&#39;s JIT compiler in the early days of the project. Before Facebook, Drew was at Microsoft where he worked on improving the performance of Microsoft&#39;s runtime and JIT compiler for .NET languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, and more) known as the Common Language Runtime.

One common form of misuse is to invoke a library function or method under circumstances where not all of its preconditions are satisfied, leading to undefined behavior. Contracts having undefined behavior are not necessarily undesirable, and (for many engineering reasons) are often optimal. Most would agree that a well-implemented library should do something other than silently continue when a pre-condition violation is detected, although these same folks might not agree on what specific action should be taken. Unfortunately, validating preconditions implies writing additional code that will execute at runtime. More code runs slower, and some would fairly argue that they should not be forced to pay for redundant runtime checks in the library software they use. Whether and to what extent library functions should validate their preconditions, and what should happen if a precondition violation is detected are questions that are best answered on an application by application basis - i.e., by the owner of main. &quot;Defensive Programming Done Right&quot; makes it all possible.<br><br>In this talk, we begin by reviewing the basic concepts of Design-By-Contract (DbC), and what we mean by the term &quot;Defensive Programming&quot; (DP). We then explore our overall approach to institutionalizing defensive programming in robust reusable library software such that each application can conveniently specify both the runtime budget (e.g., none, some, lots) for defensive checking, and also the specific action to be taken (e.g., abort, throw, spin) should a precondition violation occur. Along the way, we touch on how modern compilers and linkers work, binary compatibility, and the consequences of possibly violating the one-definition rule in mixed-mode builds. We conclude the talk by describing and then demonstrating our &quot;negative testing&quot; strategy (and supporting test apparatus) for readily verifying, in our component-level test drivers, that our defensive checks detect and report out-of-contract client use as intended.

That era has come to an end. Clock speedups have been largely replaced by having more CPUs on a chip. Your typical smart phone now has 2 to 4 cores and your typical laptop or tablet has 4 to 8 cores. Servers have dozens of cores and supercomputers have thousands of cores.<br><br>If you want to speed up a computation on modern hardware, you need to take advantage of the multiple cores available. This talk is provides an overview of the parallelism landscape. We'll explore the what, why, and how of parallel programming, discuss the distinction between parallelism and concurrency and how they overlap, and learn about the problems that one runs into. We'll conclude with an overview of existing parallelism technologies in C&#43;&#43; and the future directions being considered for parallel programming in standard C&#43;&#43;.<br>--<br>Pablo Halpern has been programming in C&#43;&#43; since 1989 and has been a member of the C&#43;&#43; Standards Committee since 2007. He is currently the Parallel Programming Languages Architect at Intel Corp., where he coordinates the efforts of teams working on Cilk Plus, TBB, OpenMP, and other parallelism languages, frameworks, and tools targeted to C&#43;&#43;, C, and Fortran users. Pablo came to Intel from Cilk Arts, Inc., which was acquired by Intel in 2009. During his time at Cilk Arts, he co-authored the paper &quot;Reducers and other Cilk&#43;&#43; Hyperobjects&quot;, which won best paper at the SPAA 2009 conference. His current work is focused on creating simpler and more powerful parallel programming languages and tools for Intel's customers and promoting adoption of parallel constructs into the C&#43;&#43; and C standards. He lives with his family in southern New Hampshire, USA. When not working on parallel programming, he enjoys studying the viola, skiing, snowboarding, and watching opera.
